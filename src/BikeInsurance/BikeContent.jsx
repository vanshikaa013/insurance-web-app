              Holding active bike insurance or two-wheeler insurance shop
              at all times is mandatory for vehicle owners in the UAE.
            </p>
            <p>Two-Wheeler insurance or a bike insurance shop offers coverage against any damages caused to the bike and/or the riders due to an unfortunate event such as a road accident, natural disaster or theft or loss of the vehicle. It provides coverage against any third-party liabilities that may arise due to injuries to one or more individuals involved in the accident.</p>
                <p>It is imperative for one to hold bike insurance or two-wheeler insurance and renew it on a timely basis because, without an insurance cover, the financial implications of an accident can cause a heavy burden on his/her savings.</p>
         <h5>Types of Bike Insurance</h5>
         <p>There are three common types of two-wheeler insurance policies:</p>

         <h6>Third-Party Liability</h6>
         <p>As an addition under the Unified Motor Insurance shop in the UAE, a third-party liability cover is the minimum level of cover that is mandatory by law in order to ride a two-wheeler on public roads. Such a shop covers the costs of damage, injury or loss to the aggrieved third party arising during the use of the shopholder’s vehicle. A third-party cover does not provide protection against damage to the insured vehicle.</p>

        <h6>Fleet Bike Insurance</h6>
        <p>Also commonly known as multi-bike insurance, fleet bike insurance is mainly beneficial for business owners that are managing delivery and courier services. Under this insurance shop, the motorcycle fleet is insured under one single shop without any wastage of time, stress or money. Fleet bike cover also provides the shopholder with the flexibility to add or remove vehicles during the tenure of the shop, whenever convenient.</p>
        
        <h6>Comprehensive Insurance</h6>
        <p>A comprehensive two-wheeler cover provides all-rounder coverage and is the highest level of the all-inclusive shop that is available in the market for bike owners. Under this shop, the shopholder is covered against any damage or injury caused during an accident, accrued third party liability during an accident, overturning, burglary, external explosion, and other malicious acts, unless specifically excluded. Such an insurance shop even pays out in case of own-fault situations.</p>
        <p>The insurance market, especially for two-wheelers has changed drastically due to the emergence of new competition. The motorbike insurance companies in today’s age offer the customer a wide range of benefits to ensure that they stick with them for a long time.Buying bike insurance is hassle-free especially with the emergence of online platforms.

        <h6>Instant  shop</h6>
        <p>Unlike before, these days, with the emergence of technology and faster financial facilities, a digitally signed insurance shop is instantly issued to the shopholder.</p>
         
         <h6>Additional Covers</h6>
         <p>There are additional covers that can be added to the base shop that is offered to the shopholder at a slightly extra premium.</p>
         

         <h6>Simple Transfer of No Claim Bonus</h6>
         <p>An NCB or No Claim Bonus transfer is offered by the bike insurance companies if the shopholder purchases a new vehicle. The NCB is offered to the owner of the vehicle and not the vehicle. 
         This bonus is offered as a reward for safe driving practices and for not making a shop claim the previous year(s).</p>
        
        <h6>Easy Purchase and Bike Insurance Renewal Online</h6>
